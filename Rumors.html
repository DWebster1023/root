	<h2> Where Will Kevin Love Being Playing Next Season? </h2>
	<p>At 5-17 and playing largely unremarkable basketball, it’s tough for the Cavaliers to wedge themselves into the national conversation these days. One way they’ve done it recently: by having a group of players anonymously complain about the methods of a first-year coach and call out everything from the way he names plays to the fact that there are assistants more ready to coach in the NBA than he is. Considering that John Beilein is coming from a college program and the franchise’s future relies on a bunch of young 20-somethings, the hope is that they can all grow together. But it doesn’t sound like the veterans on this team have the patience for that kind of lengthy timeline. That’s how we ended up here, with reports saying the Cavs are ready to start listening to offers for Kevin Love. Trade season is upon us!</p>

<h2> Wolves Rumors Heat Up As Key NBA Trade Date</h2>
	<p>On Dec. 15 every year, players who signed free agent contracts in the past offseason become eligible to be traded. And after all the activity this past summer, that means a huge influx of available players are entering the market Sunday — roughly 150, about one-third of all rostered players in the NBA, per ESPN.

There hasn’t been a trade in the league since the mid-July blockbuster sending Russell Westbrook to the Rockets and Chris Paul to the Thunder, but that figures to change with the lifting of the free agent trade moratorium and as teams start to sort themselves out as we approach the one-third mark of the season.

The Wolves could be in the middle of the action on multiple fronts. They sit on the fringe of the Western Conference playoff race with a 10-13 record, one which took a serious hit during a five-game losing streak they carry into Wednesday night’s home game with Utah. </p>

<h2> Frustration mounting within the Atlanta Hawks, team official told Trae Young they would get him more help per report
	</h2>
	<p> There might be trouble brewing in Atlanta. 

		Expectations weren't especially high for the Hawks heading into the season, as not many people expected them to be a legitimate playoff team. But, while they weren't expected to be great necessarily, they also weren't expected to be quite as bad as they have been either. Nearly a third of the way through the season, the Hawks are 6-19 and sit in 13th place in the Eastern Conference, and as a result, frustration has been mounting within the organization, according to a report from Shams Charania of The Athletic. 

		The lone bright spot for the Hawks this season has been the play of second-year guard Trae Young, who appears poised to blossom into a perennial All-Star, but even Young has been frustrated by the team's poor play, and he recently needed to be reassured by Hawks officials that the team would be looking for help leading up to February's trade deadline. </p>

<h2>Lakers Aren't Letting There Historic Start Shift Their Focus </h2>
	<p>Through 24 games this season, the Los Angeles Lakers have equaled their win total from the 2014-15 season. That’s not just a testament to how bad the Byron Scott-led Lakers were; it’s also a good indicator of how good this team has been to start the season.

The last time the Lakers went 21-3 to start the season was the 2008-09 season — the year they beat the Orlando Magic in the NBA Finals. Additionally, the 11-game road win streak they’re on is their longest streak of that kind since the 1972-73 season.

They’re not just hot — they’re on fire, but everyone in the locker room has managed to keep a cool head so far. </p>
	<h2> Anthony Davis Named NBA Western Conference Player of the Week For The Second Season</h2>
	<p>Move aside, Carmelo Anthony: There’s a new NBA Western Conference Player of the Week, and his name is Anthony Davis. On Monday, the league announced that the Los Angeles Lakers big man had been named Western Conference Player of the Week for the second time this season. It is the seventh time Davis has won the award in his career.

Davis’ honor comes fresh off of his 50-point performance against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday, which probably tipped the scales in his favor. In the game before that, he poured on 39 points on the Portland Trail Blazers. For the week, Davis averaged 35 points on 63.3% shooting from the field, 8 rebounds, 2.5 assists. 2 blocks and 1.8 steals.

LeBron James may have been the first superstar to arrive to Los Angeles last summer, but Davis is the one getting the superstar treatment and the accolades that come with it thanks to the Lakers’ NBA-best 21-3 record. He’s also been pretty good, too.

After their latest win — a 142-125 blowout over the Timberwolves — Davis talked about what it’s been like to be part of an exciting and historic time in Lakers history.

“It means a lot,” Davis said. “(There are) some greats who came through here, and to be in a class with guys like that, especially so early in my career, and first year here, it’s humbling and I’m definitely excited to be in that class.”

Davis will have plenty of opportunities cement his name in the Lakers history books this season, with the Defensive Player of the Year being the primary objective outside of winning an NBA championship, of course. If Davis is named Defensive Player of the Year at the end of the season, he’d be the first Laker since Michael Cooper during the 1986-87 season.</p>
